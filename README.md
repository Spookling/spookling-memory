# Spookling Memory

*Algorithm v2.1 · `spookling` 0.2.2 · November 2026*

**Your AI forgets you every session. It brings back the car you sold. It drops your rules the moment the chat gets long.**

Spookling Memory is built to end all three. A word-for-word log that is never edited. Facts with real dates, so an old value closes itself. A timeline written by code, not guessed by the model. **On a three-year test of facts that change, it was right 103 times out of 106 and gave 0 stale answers. Plain search: 37 right, 18 stale.**

```bash
npx spookling init
```

Every number we measured has a result file behind it in our benchmark repo; every paper and vendor number carries its source. See the [Show-Your-Work Guarantee](#the-show-your-work-guarantee) below.

| The number | What it means | The detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** stale answers | Old facts stay old | 85 chances to bring back a sold car or an old phone. It took none. Plain search took 18. |
| **103** of 106 | Facts that changed, answered right | Three years of changing jobs, phones, cities, cars. Plain search: 37 of 106. |
| **60** of 61 | Trick questions caught | Questions with no real answer, refused instead of invented. Plain search caught 40. |
| **1/3** the tokens | Tied accuracy, a third of the reading | 13,900 tokens per answer (12,500 recalled plus instructions) against 39,900 for keyword search, tied on the longest-history public test (81.5% vs 82.6%, inside the error bar). |

## The problem

**Three ways your assistant lets you down, and what each one costs you.**

### It brings back the past as if it were now

You sold the car in June. In September it plans your road trip in it. You switched phones in May; it still troubleshoots the Pixel. Every stale answer is a decision you have to catch yourself.

> **The fix: dated facts.** "Sold the car" becomes a row that says "car: none, from June". The old row closes. Nothing is deleted, nothing comes back. 0 stale answers in 85 tries.

### It loses your rules when the chat gets long

You said "always use pnpm" and "never touch the migrations folder". The chat got compacted into a summary. The rules went with it. Now you repeat yourself, or you find out after the damage.

> **The fix: the survivor block.** Before the squash, code copies your rules, choices and open items out word for word, then hands them back into every prompt. The model does not have to remember them. They are delivered. (Proven in the paper we built on; our own compaction test is being rebuilt to show it.)

### It guesses dates and counts

"How many times did I see the dentist this year?" "How long since the last deploy?" The model does arithmetic in its head and gets it wrong often enough that you stop trusting any number it gives you.

> **The fix: the code-written timeline.** Code dates every "last Tuesday", builds the timeline, counts, and measures gaps. A date known only to the month comes out as a range, never a made-up day. The model quotes; it does not calculate. (Built; on the public time questions search is still ahead, see straight talk.)

---

## What you get

**Eight pieces, each one built on a published result or our own measurement.**

Every piece exists because a paper or a measurement of ours said it had to. Pseudocode, papers and worked examples are on the [step-by-step page](https://claude.ai/artifact/MpjJEgJmviijeVTo3S3GhY). The code is in this repo, in plain Python: `server/spookling_memory/core/`.

### 01. The Never-Edited Log

Every message, word for word, with its time. Nothing is summarised, nothing is rewritten. Every other store is rebuilt from it.

**Why it matters:** a wrong summary is wrong forever. A log can always be re-read.

### 02. The Letter-for-Letter Tagger

A cheap model points at facts and events in each message using your exact words. Code checks the quoted words are really there before anything is stored.

**Why it matters:** a model that paraphrases can invent a value. A model that only points cannot.

### 03. Facts That Close Themselves

Rows like "phone = Pixel 8, true from 3 Mar up to 20 May 2025". A new value closes the old one. "What was true in December" is a lookup.

**Why it matters:** this is where the 103 of 106 and the 0 stale answers come from.

### 04. Cue-Word Events

Things that happened once, with when it happened kept apart from when it was said, and a class word stored beside your word: "the gig" is filed under "concert".

**Why it matters:** a strong model fell from 87% to 62% at 8,000 tokens when the question and the answer shared no words (NoLiMa). The cue makes it a literal match.

### 05. The Two-Hop Finder

Keyword search, meaning search, and a walk along links: my sister, then Rachel, then the places she was mentioned with. A reranker keeps the best eight snippets.

**Why it matters:** 38 of 40 right on "the place where I saw my sister" questions. Multi-hop on LoCoMo: 30 of 41, search 19.

### 06. The Code-Written Timeline

Code writes the dates part of the prompt: events in order, counts, gaps, "how long since". Month-exact dates give a range of days.

**Why it matters:** models lose 4 to 12 points when they do date math themselves (STAIR, TISER). Now they do not have to.

### 07. The Survivor Block

Up to forty lines of rules, choices, failed tries and open items, copied out before compaction and put back on top of every prompt after.

**Why it matters:** in the paper we built on, a summary kept 0 of 10 planted facts, and a re-injected block arrived 138 times out of 138.

### 08. The No-Guessing Rule

The model must first say, true or false, whether what you are assuming is actually on record. It is never offered "I don't know" as an easy exit. Code decides what happens to a refusal.

**Why it matters:** 30 of 30 unanswerable questions refused on LongMemEval; 30 wrong answers against search's 40.

## How it works

Nine boxes. Two of them are records that only grow (the log and the judgement log). The other seven are views, rebuilt from those two.

1. **Log:** every message, word for word, never changed
2. **Facts:** things true for a while, with a start and end date
3. **Events:** things that happened once, day it happened + day it was said
4. **Rules:** your standing orders, pinned on top
5. **Names:** "my sister" = Rachel, "gig" = concert
6. **Judgement log:** every call a model made, written before it changes anything
7. **Profile page:** 200 lines of what is true about you right now
8. **Survivor block:** 40 lines that come back after a chat is squashed
9. **Search index:** keyword search + meaning (semantic) search

The algorithm, trimmed to the bones:

```text
# 1. SAVE (when a chat ends)
FOR each message: APPEND to LOG
tags <- TAGGER.tag(user messages)               # exact words + labels
FOR each tag:
  IF words not in message letter-for-letter: DROP, record it
  date <- DATE_RULES(time words)                # code, never a model
  IF event: status <- happened / planned / negated
  ELSE IF flag word or odd date or unsure: SLOW_PATH
  ELSE IF first value or same value:       FACTS now
  ELSE IF change word ("sold", "new"):     close old row, open new
  ELSE:                                    SLOW_PATH   # a surprise

# 2. SORT OUT (before the next question, if anything new was saved)
FOR each item in SLOW_PATH:
  ruling <- TAGGER.rule(message, proposal, history); check its words; record it
FACTS  <- REPLAY(JUDGEMENT_LOG)
IF a key has two values on one day: STOP, keep last good, tell a human
EVENTS <- BUILD(LOG)
PROFILE_PAGE, SURVIVOR, INDEX <- rebuild

# 3. ANSWER
when   <- DATE_RULES(question) OR now
facts  <- FACTS true on when;  events <- EVENTS matching
hits   <- RERANK(KEYWORD_SEARCH + MEANING_SEARCH + LINK_WALK(names)), top 8
prompt <- [SURVIVOR, PROFILE_PAGE, facts, events, hits, TIMELINE(events), question]
reply  <- READER(prompt)       # must write Premise T/F, Values T/F, "Answer:"

# 4. DECIDE (code, not the model)
IF NOT refusal:                               RETURN answer
IF Premise=false AND search was strong:       re-ask once with the best lines
IF Values=false AND time block has a number:  re-ask once: "derive it from your quotes"
ELSE:                                         RETURN "I don't know" + what is missing

# 5. WHEN THE HARNESS SQUASHES A CHAT
KEEPERS  <- each rule / choice / failed try / open item / value / path, word for word
SURVIVOR <- RULES first, then newest KEEPERS, max 40 lines
PUT SURVIVOR on top of the next prompt
```

| Who | Does what | Runs on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tagger | points at words, adds labels, after each chat ends; rules on a flagged item | the one you pick at install: Jev, Haiku 4.5, or your Codex subscription |
| Jev (if you pick it) | answers every gate as a typed question, with a probability; code keeps only answers above the gate | OpenRouter, on your key |
| Reader | answers from the lines we hand it | the harness's model (Claude Code's own) |
| Scorers | meaning search + rerank | two tiny local models, optional, not installed by default |
| Code | every date, count, check, decision | your machine |

**No model ever** computes a date, counts, writes to Facts, or turns an answer into a refusal. The tagger points and rules on surprises, the reader quotes. Code does the rest.

**Read it yourself.** The algorithm lives in this repo, in plain Python, in `server/spookling_memory/core/`. Anyone can read it. The benchmark harness, our research notes and the result files live in a private repo.

## The receipts

**Measured, not claimed. Same questions, same reader, both arms.**

We ran Spookling Memory and the standard cheap baseline (keyword search over the same log) on the same questions with the same answering model, Claude Sonnet 5, and one strict judge that counts a wrong detail as wrong. Pass marks were written down before the runs. Percentages are over the answerable questions. We measured every number here ourselves, with our own harness, which is private. The tagger in these runs was Haiku 4.5.

| Test | Spookling | Search | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Facts that change | **103 of 106** | 37 of 106 | +62 points |
| LoCoMo, public, 239 answerable of 300 | **82.0%** | 77.8% | ahead by 4.2 points |
| LongMemEval, public, 470 answerable of 500 | **81.5%** | 82.6% | tie on score, 1/3 the tokens |
| Rules after compaction | **42 of 44** | 40 of 44 | 8 of 10, search 6 |

### Facts that change

Three years of generated chats where jobs, phones, cities and cars change on known dates. **Stale answers 0 vs 18.** Interval on the lead: +52.8 to +70.8. The widest gap on this page, and the one that matters most day to day.

### LoCoMo

300 questions sampled from the public set. **Trick questions caught: 60 of 61, search 40. Multi-hop: 30 of 41, search 19.** Interval −0.8 to +9.2, so the lead is not yet beyond doubt.

### LongMemEval

Almost the same score: the 1.1-point gap is inside the error bar (−4.7 to +2.8), so neither side can be called better. Ours reads **13,900 tokens per answer against 39,900**. Fewer wrong answers: 30 vs 40. All 30 unanswerable questions refused, search 24. Counting correct refusals over all 500: 413 vs 412. Ahead on newest-value and cross-chat questions.

### Rules after compaction

Every miss in both arms is on the rule questions. Our own suite's summary turned out to keep rules well on its own, so the next version of this test uses a real Claude Code compaction. The design rests on a published 138-of-138 result.

## Versus the field

**What only Spookling Memory does.**

The other systems are good at what they do. None of them, as far as they say, does all of this. Vendor scores are theirs, self-reported with their own readers and the benchmarks' standard yes/no judges; ours use one strict judge and a matched control arm.

| System | Log never edited | Facts with from / to dates | Dates by code, not the model | Refuses trick questions (measured) | Rules re-injected after compaction | Pre-registered pass marks, matched control arm, strict judge | Their headline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spookling Memory** | ✓ | ✓ from, up to, said on, recorded | ✓ | ✓ 60 of 61, 30 of 30 | ✓ by hook, Claude Code | ✓ | 103 of 106 on changing facts; tied with the best baseline at 1/3 the tokens |
| Plain keyword search | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ~ 40 of 61, 24 of 30 | ✗ | n/a our control arm | 82.6% LongMemEval in our run |
| A memory file the model rewrites (our own v1, the same approach as Claude Code's memory tool) | ✗ rewritten on every save | ✗ | ✗ | ? | ~ always loaded; the model decides what stays | n/a | 66 to 78 of 106 on changing facts in our run; over its size cap on 140 of 199 chats |

## The Show-Your-Work Guarantee

**Every number we measured on this page has a result file behind it in our benchmark repo. If one does not reproduce, we print the correction at the top of this page.**

Behind each number: the result file, the judge logs, both judges' verdicts, the pass marks written before the runs, and the misses we traced. They sit in our private benchmark repo, and we measured them with our own harness. What is public is the algorithm and the plugin, both in this repo. We publish our losses next to our wins; they are in the "straight talk" box below.

### Bonuses

- **Bonus 1: The step-by-step algorithm.** Every step as pseudocode, who does what, two worked examples, and the fifteen sources (papers and books) that shaped it. Built to be rebuilt by anyone.
- **Bonus 2: The research-backed design.** Twenty-seven papers and ten books on memory, retrieval and time, read end to end. The pieces above name the results they rest on, and the [sources](#sources) are listed at the bottom. Our reading notes stay in the private repo.
- **Bonus 3: The pass marks.** Ten marks written before the v2 runs, with pass, fail or still open next to each. You will know what we aimed at before you see what we hit.
- **Bonus 4: The full method write-up.** Which questions, which reader, which judges, the intervals, the floors and ceilings, and what every run cost. It is all in [Method, pass marks and cost](#method-pass-marks-and-cost) below.

## Early access

**Claude Code and Codex. One command. Your data stays yours.**

In Codex, the pixel ghost shows in the hook messages: `ready` after a successful server health check, with the messages, facts and standing rules the server holds beside it; `active` after successful recall, green, with what was recalled (a search with no matching facts is one `active` line, not a ghost). Failed health checks or recall show the `degraded` ghost and do not block Codex. This is a hook indicator, not a permanent widget; [setup and removal](cli/README.md#codex) use the same local server and `.memory/` data. In Claude Code the same ghost is the status line.

Spookling Memory is out as `spookling` 0.2.2, early access. Claude Code and Codex use native hooks; the Spookling app follows. A `.memory/` folder, one plugin, the reader your harness already runs, and a tagger you pick. New in 0.2.0: team memory. After `spookling login`, your sessions upload privately, you can share one or a whole project with an org, and your agent can read what colleagues shared. It is opt-in; without a login nothing changes. [Team memory](#team-memory).

New in 0.2.1: turns are saved before any model is called, so a tagger key that runs out or stops working no longer loses a chat ([When the tagger key stops working](#when-the-tagger-key-stops-working)); every assistant reply in a turn is logged, not only the last one; turns can be up to 16,000 characters; `spookling backfill` puts back turns missing from `.memory/`; and `spookling delete` (or `memory_delete` from chat) removes uploaded sessions from the cloud.

New in 0.2.2: sharing is easier. `spookling share` with no id shares the current session; a session that has not uploaded yet is uploaded on demand or queued as a pending share; `spookling unshare` cancels it; org lists are read live; `spookling refresh` also retries queued uploads and shares; and `init` can let Claude share for you through an allow rule for five share tools. See [Team memory](#team-memory).

**Upgrading.** On 0.1.x, run `npx spookling init` once. From 0.2 on, run `spookling update`. Why: [Updating](#updating).

```bash
npx spookling init
```

---

## Install

One command. One wizard. No config files to hand-edit.

```bash
npx spookling init                 # this project
npx spookling init --scope user    # every project you open in Claude Code
npx spookling demo                 # the whole install, answered for you; writes nothing
npx spookling status               # is the server up, what is wired, which tagger
npx spookling backfill [--since <date>] [--all]   # log turns missing from .memory/ back from your Claude Code transcripts; safe to repeat
npx spookling uninstall            # remove the hooks and the MCP entry; keep .memory/
npx spookling update [--check] [--version x [--force]]   # install the newest version and re-wire what you already set up
npx spookling restore [<timestamp>] [--yes]   # list the config backups, or put one run's files back
npx spookling login                # sign in in the browser; init never logs in
npx spookling logout               # forget the saved token
npx spookling whoami               # who you are, the API and your default org
npx spookling orgs                 # the orgs you belong to
npx spookling tokens               # your CLI tokens; `tokens revoke <id>` or `--all` to revoke
npx spookling refresh              # pull the org feeds into the local cache, and retry queued uploads and shares
npx spookling sessions [project]   # your newest 20 uploaded sessions (--all, --limit N)
npx spookling share <session id>   # share a session with an org (unshare to stop)
npx spookling autoshare <project> on|off   # share every new session of a project
npx spookling delete <session id>   # delete an uploaded session from the cloud (--all for every one)
```

The team commands are explained under [Team memory](#team-memory), `update` under [Updating](#updating) and `restore` under [Backups and restore](#backups-and-restore); `cli/README.md` has the flags.

`spookling init` stays offline. `spookling login` is the separate step that connects you to the Spookling app:

- **Sign in.** It opens your browser, shows a code to confirm, and waits for approval. It retries through a flaky network until the code expires.
- **Default org.** When you approve, it saves a default org: the only one, or the one you pick from your orgs.
- **Past sessions.** If it finds sessions in this project's or your home `.memory/log.jsonl` that were never uploaded, it asks whether to upload them privately. The default is yes, and with no terminal it takes yes after 20 seconds. Other projects upload when their next session stops. A failed upload never fails the login.
- **Where the token goes.** It talks to the Spookling app (`https://api.spookling.com`) and saves the token in `~/.spookling/credentials.json` (mode `0600`) together with the server that issued it. The token only ever goes to that server (see [Advanced](#advanced)) and is never printed.
- **The sign-in link** is opened only when it is on the API's host or a `spookling.com` host; on another host it asks first (default No) at a terminal, and is only printed with a warning when there is none.
- **Afterwards.** `spookling whoami` prints your name and email, the API URL and your orgs, asked of the API just now (never from a cache). If the API cannot be reached, commands say `Couldn't reach <url>`.

You need Node 18 or newer and Claude Code v2.1.139 or later. The server runs on uv, which fetches Python 3.12 if you do not have it.

It opens with a cutscene: the Spookling wordmark builds in block letters and the ghost flies across your terminal. Any key skips it. Then seven steps:

1. **Checks your machine.** Node, then uv. No uv? It shows the one-line install for your OS and offers to run it.
2. **Asks which harness you use.** Claude Code or Codex. Codex users review/trust the installed hooks through `/hooks`.
3. **Asks how the tagger should run.** Three choices, in the table below. A key is typed hidden, saved to `.memory/keys.env`, and never printed.
4. **Installs the local memory server.** It copies the server and the hooks to a folder per user and version: `~/.spookling-memory/<version>/`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\spookling-memory\<version>\` on Windows. It runs `uv sync` there and starts the server on 127.0.0.1:7447. Nothing Claude Code runs lives in the npx cache.
5. **Wires Claude Code.** Three hooks that call the server: `Stop` saves the chat when it ends, `UserPromptSubmit` hands the right lines to each prompt, `PreCompact` copies the survivor block out before the squash. Plus the MCP server, so Claude can call the memory tools, and, if you say yes, the ghost in the status line. `--scope project` (the default) writes this project's files; `--scope user` writes yours, for every project.
6. **Runs a smoke test.** It asks the server for its stats. You see it answer before you leave the wizard.
7. **Shows a done screen.** The ghost flies once more. "Spookling Memory is in."

Every file is shown before it is written, and `n` skips it. Without a terminal (an assistant's shell, a pipe), the wizard never hangs: a question nobody answers for 20 seconds takes its default.

### The three taggers

| Choice | What runs | Cost | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Jev through an OpenRouter key** (the default) | A cheap router model picks the words. Jev decides every gate in its Choice and Noul modes, each answer with a probability. Code takes a yes only at 0.8 or higher, and a pick from a list only at 0.6 or higher. | the cheapest: about $0.002 a chat | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| **2. An Anthropic API key** | Haiku 4.5 | Anthropic's API price | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **3. Your Codex subscription** | the `codex` CLI, one `codex exec` per call | a little of your plan's allowance; several seconds a chat | `codex`, logged in with ChatGPT (Plus or higher) |

To switch, stop the server (`uninstall` offers to) and run `init` again. `status` shows which tagger is running.

### When the tagger key stops working

Every turn is written to `.memory/log.jsonl` before the tagger is asked, so a key that is over its limit, invalid or out of credit never loses a chat, and uploads keep working. The server stops calling the model, `status` shows a `model` line with the reason and the time, and the hooks answer without recall instead of failing. Turns not yet tagged wait in `.memory/pending.json` and are tagged on the next call that works, or when the server starts again. Top up or change the key in `.memory/keys.env`, then run `spookling init --update`. Turns an older version dropped while the key was failing come back with `spookling backfill`.

### What it writes

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.spookling-memory/<version>/` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\spookling-memory\<version>\` on Windows) | the server and the hooks, copied from the package; `uv sync` makes the server's `.venv` there |
| `.claude/settings.json` (project) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (user) | three hooks merged in: `PreCompact`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`; and the ghost's `statusLine`, if you said yes |
| `.mcp.json` (project) or Claude Code's user MCP list (user) | the `spookling-memory` server and its tools, `memory_retrieve` and `memory_reset` among them |
| `.codex/config.toml` (project) or `~/.codex/config.toml` (user), Codex only | the `spookling-memory` MCP server as `[mcp_servers.spookling-memory]`, so Codex can call the memory and team tools. Codex loads a project file only for a trusted project |
| `.memory/` | your memory, your tagger's key in `keys.env`, the server's pid and log, and a `.gitignore` that keeps the key and the caches out of git |

Every other key in those files is kept. A file that is not valid JSON is left alone and reported, never overwritten. In an interactive session, Claude Code runs the hooks once you trust the folder, and asks you once to approve a project `.mcp.json` server. `/hooks` and `/mcp` show what is wired. With the server down, the hooks print nothing and exit 0 within about a second, so a prompt is never blocked.

### Advanced

Most people never need these.

- **A different server** (self-hosted or staging): `spookling login --api-url https://api.example.com`, or set `SPOOKLING_API_URL` for that login. The address is saved with the token.
- **CI and headless machines:** set `SPOOKLING_TOKEN` to a token from `spookling tokens`, together with an explicit `SPOOKLING_API_URL`. A token from the environment is never paired with a default server.
- **Safety rule:** a saved login only talks to the server it was issued by. `SPOOKLING_API_URL` cannot redirect it, so a repo's settings or an `.envrc` cannot send your token elsewhere; a command that sees a different value ignores it and says so. Servers must use `https` (plain `http` only for localhost).

### Updating

```bash
spookling update                 # install the newest version and re-wire everything you already set up
spookling update --check         # only report: exit 0 when current, 10 when an update is available
spookling update --version 0.2.0 --force   # a specific version (0.2.0 is just an example); going backwards needs --force
```

From 0.2 on, `spookling update` is the way to upgrade. 0.1.x has no `update` command, so on 0.1.x run `npx spookling init` once first. Either way, each version installs into its own folder under `~/.spookling-memory/` and `init` leaves the old one in place, so your hooks and MCP entries keep using the old folder (it still works) until you do.

`update` asks the npm registry for the latest `spookling`, then runs that version's own `npx --yes spookling@<version> init --update`: the init steps again, with no questions.

- **What it repeats:** what is already wired (Claude Code and/or Codex, project and/or user scope, the ghost on or off, the tagger, whether the server runs). It reads that from `~/.spookling/install.json` (written, mode `0600`, after every successful `init`) and from the hooks, MCP entries and server actually on disk.
- **Outside a wired project:** it updates your user scope only and names the project installs it knows about.
- **The running server:** one still running from an older version folder is stopped (only when its command line shows it is ours) and started again from the new one.
- **Old versions:** their folders are never deleted. It prints `Old version kept in ~/.spookling-memory/<old> (safe to delete once you're happy).`
- **Afterwards:** restart open Claude Code and Codex sessions.
- **Offline, or no `npx`:** it prints the manual route and exits 1. `npx spookling@latest init` still works and asks its questions as before.

`status` and `whoami` print `! update   <version> is available. Run spookling update.` The check runs at most once every 24 hours with a 2 second limit, is cached in `~/.spookling/update-check.json`, never runs from hooks, the MCP server or `init`, and is skipped in CI.

### Backups and restore

Before `init`, `init --update`, `update` or `uninstall` changes a config file, it copies the file to `~/.spookling/backups/<timestamp>/` (files `0600`, folder `0700`) and ends with `Backups of the files I changed: ~/.spookling/backups/<timestamp>/`. That covers `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude.json` (before `claude mcp` edits it), the Claude desktop config, `~/.codex/hooks.json` and `config.toml`, and a project's `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json` and `.codex/` files. The newest 20 runs are kept; an older run is removed only once it is 7 days old. Files are re-read right before they are written, and a JSON or TOML file that does not parse is refused and left exactly as it was, with the file and the reason named. Only Spookling's own keys are merged in or out.

```bash
spookling restore                      # list the backup runs and their files
spookling restore 20261104-183005      # an example timestamp: show what would change, ask, then restore (current versions are backed up first)
spookling restore 20261104-183005 --yes   # without a terminal
```

### Upgrading by hand

Until `init` or `update` re-points them, a new version's changes (new MCP tools, title and project fixes) do not reach your hooks and MCP entries. In the meantime `status` exits 1 and shows a line like `! upgrade  hooks still use 0.1.3. Run spookling update to finish upgrading to 0.2.1.` (the versions are an example). On 0.1.x, finish with `npx spookling init`, as in [Updating](#updating).

### Where it runs

Windows (native PowerShell, no Git Bash needed), macOS and Linux, WSL included. Windows 11 and Linux (WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04) were run by hand. macOS runs the same code in CI. One server in WSL can serve Claude Code on both sides; `cli/README.md` has the steps.

### The ghost

![Claude Code with the ghost in its status line: "1 fact · 1 rule · 2 past chats recalled"](cli/renders/ghost-status-line.png)

In Claude Code a small ghost sits in the status line under the prompt (`init` asks; `--no-ghost` skips it). It says what memory last did, in plain words: `3 facts · 1 rule recalled` while Claude answers, `saved` after, `kept your 2 rules and 38 lines` after a compaction, `remembering you` when nothing is new, `asleep, server off` when the server is down. Its arms go up and down between refreshes; the words change only when memory does something. When a prompt recalls something, one quiet line lands under it: `👻 3 facts and 1 rule from memory`. Standing rules alone, a save or a compaction add nothing to the conversation. Already have a status line? Yours stays first with the ghost after it, and `uninstall` puts yours back exactly.

## Reader and tagger

**Two models touch your memory. Only one of them is ours.**

- **The reader is your harness's own model.** In Claude Code, that is the model Claude Code already runs. We hand it the lines; it answers. There is no reader of ours to pay for.
- **The tagger is ours. It runs after each chat ends.** It reads the chat once, points at facts and events in your exact words, and code checks every quote. Retrieval never calls it. A flagged item goes back to it once for a ruling.
- **With Jev,** a cheap router model picks the words and Jev makes every decision, with a probability we gate on.
- **There is no Claude subscription tagger.** Anthropic's terms do not allow a third-party product to route requests through a Claude Free, Pro or Max plan. Use an Anthropic API key instead.
- **A Codex subscription is allowed.** Codex's docs cover `codex exec` signed in with ChatGPT. The server runs it read-only, from an empty temp folder, with web search off, and keeps API keys out of its environment so the bill stays on your plan. Your plan's terms and limits apply.

**What Claude sees.** A hook can hand Claude at most 10,000 characters per prompt; that is Claude Code's cap, and the server cuts the recalled block there. The full block is one tool call away: `memory_retrieve`.

---

## Paste this into Claude Code

Rather have your assistant do it? [`PASTE-ME.md`](PASTE-ME.md) has one block for Claude Code and one for Codex. Each has your assistant run `init` in the foreground, never answer the wizard's questions itself, check `status`, and reply "Spookling Memory is in." Claude Code's shell has no live terminal, so the ghost does not fly there. Run `npx spookling demo` in your own terminal to see it.

---

## Team memory

Optional, and only after `spookling login`. `init` never logs in and works offline; with no login the hooks upload nothing.

**Upload.** Once you are logged in, each Stop hook uploads the finished session to the Spookling app, named after its git repo.

- **Private:** only you can see it until you share it.
- **What goes up:** the cleaned turns from `.memory/log.jsonl`, cut to 16,000 characters each (a cut ends with "…"), with secrets masked first. `log.jsonl` itself is not changed.
- **What is masked:** API keys, AWS key IDs, GitHub tokens, `NAME_TOKEN=value` lines, JWTs, PEM private-key blocks, `scheme://user:pass@` URLs, Slack tokens, Stripe keys. This is pattern matching, so a secret in another shape still gets through.
- **Network down:** the turns wait in `~/.spookling/upload-state.json` and go up on a later Stop. Upload progress is remembered per account and server, so switching either starts cleanly; if the server holds fewer turns than expected, the client asks it where it is and resends from there.
- **Refused for good:** that session is skipped and the rest still upload. This covers one shared with an org you have since left (`org_owned`), one past the 10,000-turn limit, and one over the 10,000-session account limit (which also pauses creating new sessions for that push). `spookling status` names them.
- **401:** stops the push, and `status` then says `login expired, run spookling login`. Tokens expire after 90 days unused or 365 days after they were issued.
- **Tokens:** `spookling tokens` lists the tokens on your account (label, created, last used, and which is this device). `spookling tokens revoke <id>` (a unique prefix of 6 or more characters works) or `--all` revokes them; revoking this device's token, or all, also forgets the saved login.

**Share.** Sharing is a separate step you take, per session or per project:

```bash
spookling orgs                          # your orgs, as id and name
spookling sessions [project] [--limit N | --all]   # newest 20 uploaded sessions: private, or shared with which org; plus auto-share rules
spookling share [<session id> | --last] [--org <id or name>] [--yes]   # no id: the current session, else this project's newest
spookling unshare <session id> [--org <id or name>]   # all orgs without --org
spookling autoshare <project> on|off [--org <id or name>] [--backfill]
spookling delete <session id> [--yes]   # delete one uploaded session from the cloud
spookling delete --all [--yes]          # delete all of yours, in batches
```

`--org` can be left out: `share` and `autoshare on` then use your default org (saved at login), or your only org. `unshare`, `autoshare off` and `refresh` without `--org` cover every org. `autoshare on` shares every new session of that project; `--backfill` also shares the ones already uploaded. `off` removes the rule; sessions already shared stay shared. Sharing shows the cleaned turns to every active member of the org, and unsharing hides them again but cannot un-tell someone who already read them. The org owns what is shared to it.

**Four ways to share a session:**

- **Ask Claude.** Say "share this session". Claude calls `memory_share`, and Spookling shows its own confirmation dialog naming the session and the org. Nothing is shared without your yes.
- **`/spookling-share [org]`.** A slash command that `init` writes to `.claude/commands/spookling-share.md` (or your Claude config folder with `--scope user`). Typing it is your confirmation, so it shares the current session without a dialog.
- **`spookling share [id] [--org X] [--last] [--yes]`.** With no id it takes the current session (the one a terminal inside Claude Code runs in, else the newest in this project, else your newest upload). It asks first unless `--yes`, and prints the session's web link when it can build one. `--last` is the same as leaving the id out.
- **The Share button** in the web app.

**Orgs are always checked live.** The default org is saved with the API and account it was chosen under; if either changes (a new login, another API such as a local one), the default and the cached team feed (`~/.spookling/team-feed.json`, which also records its API and user) are ignored, and `login` and `logout` delete the old feed. When you share, the default is checked against your live orgs: if it is gone, Spookling says so, uses your only org, or (with several) asks you to pick. `spookling share` names the org it picked, shows a picker in a terminal when you have several and gave no `--org`, and needs `--org` without a terminal. `spookling orgs`, `whoami` and `status` list your live orgs. For Claude, the MCP tool `team_orgs` does the same, and Claude is told never to state your orgs from memory.

**No dialog in your client?** Some clients cannot show MCP confirmation dialogs. Then `memory_share` shares nothing and returns the session title, project, org (resolved live) and a command to give you, for example `spookling share <id> --org 'Org test'` (it shows what will be shared and asks you), plus `/spookling-share <org>` for the current session. Claude is told to relay it word for word and not to guess the org.

**The allow rule.** `init` asks, and so does `login` (once, and only where Spookling's hooks are wired and no rule is set yet): "Let Claude share sessions to your team when you ask? Spookling still asks you to confirm each share." A yes adds five tools to `permissions.allow` in `.claude/settings.json` (or your user settings with `--scope user`): `mcp__spookling-memory__memory_share`, `memory_share_status`, `team_sessions`, `team_session` and `team_orgs` (all read-only). Anyone who said yes before gets only the new `team_orgs` rule, without a question, at `init --update`, `update` or the next `login`; a no stays a no. `memory_delete` and `memory_autoshare` are never added.

- `init --allow-share` adds the rules without asking; `init --no-allow-share` leaves them out without asking. Without either flag, init asks at a terminal and otherwise skips the question and says how to allow it.
- A "no" is remembered in `~/.spookling/share-allow.json`, so `login` and `spookling update` do not ask again. `init` always asks.
- `uninstall` removes only the rules Spookling itself added (it records them per settings file in `share-allow.json`; a rule you had before stays, even if it is one of the five) and the `/spookling-share` command, as it removes the hooks.

**Pending shares.** Sharing a session that is not saved yet uploads it now from its local log. If that fails, the share is queued and applies after the session's next save. `unshare` cancels a queued share, and `memory_share_status` reports it as `share pending`. A queued share is dropped after 7 days (noted in `~/.spookling/upload.log`). If the server refuses a queued share when it is applied (not a member, session or org gone, login rejected), the share is dropped and the next `spookling share`, `sessions`, `status` or `memory_share_status` says so once, for example `Share of 'Fix login' to Acme did not apply: 403 not a member`. A session id you type that is in no local log and not on the server is an error (`No session <id> found here or in the cloud`) and queues nothing. `spookling refresh` retries queued uploads and shares and prints the result.

**Delete.** `spookling delete <session id>` removes one uploaded session from the cloud; `spookling delete --all` removes every session you uploaded. It deletes the cloud copy only: local memory (`.memory/`) is never touched. On a terminal it asks first (`--all` asks you to type `DELETE`); without a terminal it refuses unless you pass `--yes`. Sessions shared with an org belong to the org: they are kept and listed as skipped. A deleted session is marked in `~/.spookling/upload-state.json` and never uploads again, even if you keep working in it; sessions you start later upload as usual. Deleting a session that is already gone counts as done. The MCP tool `memory_delete(session_id | all=true)` does the same from chat, and always opens a yes/no dialog first (for one session and for all); a client that cannot show it gets the `spookling delete` command to run instead.

You can also ask in the chat: when you are logged in, the prompt hook tells Claude the session id (and nothing else), and the MCP tools `memory_share`, `memory_autoshare` and `memory_share_status` do the same as the commands above. Sharing from chat (`memory_share`, `memory_autoshare on`, and always `--backfill`) first opens a yes/no dialog in your client (MCP elicitation) that names the session or project, the org and, for a backfill, how many sessions; nothing happens without your yes. If your client cannot show that dialog, the tool does nothing and tells Claude to have you run the `spookling share` or `spookling autoshare` command yourself. Unsharing and `autoshare off` reduce exposure and need no confirmation. Text inside a colleague's session can never trigger any of this. `memory_export` and `memory_import` read and write only `~/.spookling/exports/`, and `memory_export` will not replace a file unless `overwrite` is true.

**Forks.** A forked Claude Code conversation (a side chat, or a continued session) starts with lines copied from its parent. It uploads as its own session linked to the parent: only the turns it adds are sent, numbered from 0, with `parentSessionId`, `branchedAtTurn` (the parent's turn it branched after) and `relation` (`side_chat`, or `continued` when Claude Code left a summary marker). Its title is its first new message. A fork uploaded before this existed is linked on its next upload; its copied turns stay on the server, which only appends. `spookling sessions` shows forks as `↳ … (side chat of <parent>)`, and `team_sessions` / `team_session` give an agent `branchedFrom` with how to read the parent.

**Read.** Colleagues' agents read what you shared through two MCP tools, `team_sessions` (list and filter by query, person, project or org) and `team_session` (one session, in full). Each call refreshes every org feed on demand first, then reads the local cache (`~/.spookling/team-feed.json`); if the refresh fails it answers from the cache and says it may be stale. There is no background pull, and the hooks never put colleague text in your prompt: the model calls these tools, and what comes back is quoted data, wrapped so the agent does not follow instructions inside it. `spookling refresh [--org <id or name>]` pulls the feeds by hand. When an org has more than 500 shared sessions the feed says its id list is truncated, and refresh then keeps every cached session instead of purging the ones it did not list.

**`status`.** `npx spookling status` has a `cloud` line: who you are logged in as (or `not logged in`), the last sync, the pending turns and the shares waiting for their session to upload (a refused share is shown there once). It reads local files only, so it never waits on the network. "Last sync" is the newest feed time from the last `refresh` or team-tool call, `never` if there has been none; it says nothing about uploads. "Pending" is the number of turns queued in `upload-state.json` that the server has not accepted yet, usually because you were offline; turns that Stop has not reached yet are not counted. A session skipped after a repeated `seq_conflict` is listed on its own `upload` line.

**Troubleshooting.**

- **"Claude was blocked from sharing."** Claude Code denied the tool call, or no confirmation dialog could be shown, and Claude is told not to retry. Run `/spookling-share` in the chat or `spookling share` in a terminal, or accept the allow rule above.
- **Upload errors.** Each failed upload is logged to `~/.spookling/upload.log` with its HTTP status and error code, for example `upload queued: 500 INTERNAL_ERROR`. A 5xx is a problem on the Spookling server, not on your machine: the turns stay queued and go up at the next Stop or the next login. `spookling refresh` does not retry uploads.

## Your memory moves with you

Your memory is not locked inside a tool. It is a folder of plain files.

`.memory/` goes in the folder you run `init` in. With `--scope project`, that is the project. With `--scope user`, it is your home folder: run `init` there, and every project talks to that one memory.

It holds two records. Both are append-only. Nothing in them is ever rewritten.

- **`log.jsonl`, the log.** Every message, word for word, with its time.
- **`judgements.jsonl`, the judgement log.** Every call a model made, and every reset, written before it changes anything.

Everything else rebuilds: facts, events, rules, names, the profile page, the survivor block, the search index. Facts are rebuilt by replaying the judgement log, so past calls are reused, not re-guessed. A view is never the only copy of anything. Beside them sit caches, your key, and the server's pid and log.

So moving is one file. Export writes a `.spookling` archive of the two records. Import restores it into an empty memory and rebuilds every view. The same question gets the same context before and after.

```text
memory_export      # MCP tool in Claude Code: writes the archive to a path you name
memory_import      # MCP tool: restores it into an empty memory; the views rebuild
GET  /v1/export    # the same over HTTP, on 127.0.0.1:7447
POST /v1/import    # the archive, as application/octet-stream
```

Import into a fresh install, before its first chat. The archive is the same for every harness. Start in Claude Code or Codex. Carry the same memory between them or to a new machine today, and to the Spookling app when it lands. Same facts, same rules, same history. No re-teaching. No vendor holding your past hostage.

---

## Reset without regret

New job. New project. A month you would rather your assistant stopped bringing up. One click makes everything before now irrelevant.

Reset writes one "reset" ruling to the judgement log at time T. From then on:

- **Every open fact closes at T.** It stops being true now. It is still true for the dates it covered.
- **Every event before T is marked "before reset".** It shows up only when you ask about a date before T.
- **Rules and survivor lines from before T are unpinned.** They stop riding on every prompt. They are kept.
- **Nothing is deleted.** Reset is one more line in a record that only grows.

Changed your mind? Undo appends the reverse ruling. Everything comes back as it was. The ghost was only resting.

For builders:

```text
POST /v1/reset         # one "reset" ruling at now
POST /v1/reset/undo    # the reverse ruling; everything returns
```

The same reset is the `memory_reset` MCP tool in Claude Code (`undo: true` reverses it). The reset button in the Spookling app calls `POST /v1/reset`. This repo ships the endpoint; the button lives in the app.

Reset is not delete. If you need data gone for good, that is the purge command, which is on the list (see Privacy).

## Straight talk

- **Out now, in early access.** The package is published. The Claude Code wiring of the decision rule's re-ask is still in progress, and our compaction test cannot yet show the survivor block's effect. The numbers come from our benchmark runner, build 6.0, re-scored with the v2.1 rule (the "derive it" re-asks re-run, the look-again re-asks pending).
- **Where search still beats us:** time questions on LongMemEval (92 vs 106 of 127; the fix is built and in the pending run) and fewer refusals (42 to our 57). Our weakest spot is two-hop by a person's other name, 12 of 35.
- **Tagging costs money up front.** On a one-question-per-history benchmark that made our run cost 2.2x search; where thirty questions share a history, 1.06x. Real use reads each memory many times.
- **The leaders self-report 94 to 96%** with the benchmarks' yes/no judges and their own readers. We score with a strict judge; we will publish a lenient-judge pass beside it. Our fixes were made after seeing the misses on every suite here; a held-out split is next.

---

## Method, pass marks and cost

For the people who want the detail. The result files sit in our private benchmark repo; the method is all here.

- Reader Claude Sonnet 5 in both arms; strict three-way judge on Sonnet 5; second judge Haiku 4.5 (agreement 0.85 to 0.94; 0.56 on the two-hop suite). Intervals from 1,000 bootstrap resamples.
- Updates: 120 questions (106 answerable), our generated suite. LongMemEval: all 500 (470 answerable). LoCoMo: 300 of 1,986 sampled with seed 7 (239 answerable, 61 traps); its answer key is about 6.4% wrong (Penfield audit, April 2026). Compaction: 50 (44 answerable). Two-hop: 150, no search control yet.
- Floors with no memory, Haiku reader: LongMemEval 1 of 470, LoCoMo 2 of 1,540, updates 0 of 106, compaction 41 of 44. Ceilings with the whole history: updates 81 of 106 with Haiku, 106 of 106 with Opus.
- Pass marks (13 October 2026): stale under 5% pass (0); retired facts as gone pass (9 of 9); unanswerable refused 90%+ pass on every suite; early facts within 10 of late pass; instructions 90%+ fail (8 of 10); store under 25% of log pass (22%); reader tokens under 25% of everything pass (12%); judge agreement pass except two-hop; human audit open; the pre-registered target (beat the leaders with the lower interval bound) not met.
- Run cost, list price, search first: updates $0.65 / $2.73 (4.2x); compaction $1.17 / $1.75 (1.5x); LoCoMo $9.94 / $10.55 (1.06x); LongMemEval $42.19 / $94.60 (2.2x). Our runs include tagging every history once (about 105,000 tagger tokens per 115k-token history).
- The numbers come from benchmark build 6.0 (algorithm v2 stores) re-scored with the v2.1 decision rule; a fresh v2.1 run is 108 of 500 in.
- Tagger in these runs: Haiku 4.5. The Jev and Codex taggers have no scores on this page yet.

### Privacy

What leaves your machine, and when:

- **Each chat goes to the tagger's API once, after it ends.** OpenRouter for Jev (Jev's decisions go there too, on the same key), Anthropic for Haiku, OpenAI through your own `codex` login for Codex.
- **The reader is your harness.** Recalled lines ride along with your prompt to the model Claude Code already talks to. We send them nowhere else.
- **A flagged item goes once more,** to the same tagger (or to Jev), with its message: a contradiction, a rule, a correction, a doubtful date, a low-confidence tag, an unlisted class.

- **If you log in, finished sessions upload to the Spookling app,** private to you until you share them (see [Team memory](#team-memory)). Without a login nothing is uploaded.

The server listens on 127.0.0.1 only. Pasted secrets can land in the log. Each new turn has its keys and tokens masked before it is logged (`sk-` keys, AWS key IDs, GitHub tokens, `NAME_TOKEN=value` lines), and uploaded turns are masked again, with JWTs, private-key blocks, URL credentials, Slack tokens and Stripe keys added. A secret in another shape gets through, and the log is append-only. A purge command is on the list. Keep `.memory/` out of shared repos until then.
